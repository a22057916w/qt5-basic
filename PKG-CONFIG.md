## Linux Cli: pkg-config

pkg-config is a computer program that defines and supports a unified interface for querying `installed libraries` for the purpose of compiling software that depends on them. It allows programmers and installation scripts to work without explicit knowledge of detailed library path information. 

It outputs various information about installed libraries. This information may include: 
* Parameters (flags) for C or C++ compiler
* Parameters (flags) for linker
* Version of the package in question
